# My Personal Portfolio

This is the source code for my current portfolio. (http://tsubasafujii.com)<br />
It's built in **React** and styled by **Styled Components**.

## Design
- I wanted to make something fun and happy but simple
- I made sure that the **contract ratio** of text and background color is good enough to read.
- Switching dark & light mode with help of **React Context**.
- Sharing theme values with react context
